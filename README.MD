# ***ImgFormat***

This GUI application allows you to convert **images** to any format which you can imagine. While many websites offer similar services, they often take more time and include ads. With **ImgFormat**, you can convert images fast and easy, saving both time and hassle! I created this app to make my work with photo easier and faster.

## Features
1. **Ad-free:** Enjoy a seamless experience without interruptions.
2. **No API Needed:** Convert directly without the need for any API keys or extra configuration. Clone and run!
3. **Quick Conversion:** On Intel Core i3 10'th Gen it takes less than 2 seconds to convert image!
4. **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for a more intuitive experience. Our app has plenty amount of useful GUI features, which make this app very easy to use even for kids. 
5. **Optimised for low resolution monitors:** I know that a lot of people continue to use their ThinkPads etc. from 2004 or even older, so I decided to optimise this app for theirs displays. This app should work fine and not take a lot of space on your monitor even if he has only a 640x320 display resolution. On i3 manager you even can change a size of any window which this app will show to you, but I'm not sure about other window managers.
6. **Regular Updates:** This app is always up to date, so you can never care about her availability. We will notificate you about new available updates every time when you run this app.
7. **Compatible with old computers:** It should work fine even if you have a very old computer. I think that even any laptop from 2004 or even older will be able to work with this app without any issues, but be sure that he has a compatible OS!
8. **Any Formats:** You can enter your own format and app will try to find him.
9. **Offline:** This app is fully offline.

> [!NOTE]
> At this moment I create this app fully alone, literally without any help. It will be nice to have a command of 2-3 people, just to work on our app faster. I go to school and have a busy schedule, so I'm not able to code all day long, especially because at home I have some problems with internet connection and don't have a computer. So, I'm always ready to start to work on this app together with you!
